# Il-Mio-Corpo

For Linux Users:
To avoid the "no usable version of libssl was found " error, download [openssl1.0](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl1.0/)

Ubuntu 22.04 installs Open ssl 3.0 per default but Unity for Linux currently uses .Net5 per default and therefore can only run with Open ssl 1.0 or 1.1.
